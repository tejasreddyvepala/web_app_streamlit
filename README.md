this is a repository on web application using streamlit and python.
# building a data science web application using streamlit library and python libraries

download the "Motor_Vehicle_Collisions_._crashes.csv" from the following link:
  https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/motor-vehicle-collisions-crashes/resource/b5a431d2-4832-43a6-9334-86b62bdb033f

Step 1:
  import the streamlit library.
  if streamlit library is not to found or not yet installed. Use the following command:

Step 2:
  load the data and make changes like removing null values and changing the names of the columns for convenience.

Step 3:
  visualize data on map

step 4:
  3D interactive visualization

step 5:
  histograms and charts.

step 6:
  go through the code thoroughly and experimenting on information we have already given to exploit more options.

# Note:
if while running the command "streamlit run app2.py" if there is an instance already running on the system for the local host address.Run the command below in the terminal.
# export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE
by running this command you will fing it that the code re starts.
